MLB Free Agency Analysis for the New York Mets
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing MLB free agent batters for the New York Mets to help the team make informed decisions on which players to target during the 2024-2025 free agency period. The goal is to identify areas of improvement, particularly in offensive metrics where the Mets need strengthening.

- What positions are the New York Mets lacking in? 
- Where do the Mets need to improve offensively based on last seasons stats? 
- Which free agent batters would add the most value to the Mets, considering areas of offensive need and performance? 
- Based on the Mets positional needs, which players are the best options for improvement? 
- What is the correlation between player age and recent performance in free agency?
